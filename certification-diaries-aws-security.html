    <h1>The Certification Diaries: AWS Certified Security - Specialty Course</h1>
    <div class="meta">Week 1 of my AWS Security Specialty journey &middot; #AWS #Security #Certification</div>
    <p><strong>Hosts, Networks, and Not Losing It</strong></p>
    <p>I started the AWS Security Specialty this week and, honestly, my brain wanted to back out so quickly, I got mental whiplash. What Am I Doing?! I can't possibly understand something this complicated… But when starting anything scary or daunting, I took a deep breath and promised to take it one step at a time and see what happens. For the sake of the journey, that's all.</p>
    <p>I've started this blog series, "The Certification Diaries", to take you all along my certification journey and share insights and lessons I learn along the way.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>To preface this series, I would like to state for the record that there is no RIGHT way or WRONG way to study. Yes, many people will have their opinions and advice, but ultimately, I believe that the way that works for you IS the way that works. I am not working with a strict deadline, but I am working with a structured routine to keep myself on track and focused for the next 90 days. I'll see how far I get. No pressure!</p>
    <p>Ready? Deep Breath. Off we go.</p>
    <p>To start the journey off, I am doing the SCS-C02: AWS Certified Security - Speciality Specialisation on Coursera. This course attracted me as it starts off with covering the fundamentals and then moves on to the harder concepts and further deep dives.</p>
    <p>This first week has looked at how to keep hosts and networks secure. Or, to put it another way: How to keep the machine itself safe (host security) and keep the streets around it calm and secure (network security).</p>
    <h2>Host Security</h2>
    <p>I used to think "host security" meant making sure that instances had everything they needed to stay secure — SSM Agent, CloudWatch Agent, Antivirus, Encryption, Backups, Security Groups, NACLs and a big sign saying "KEEP OUT". Now I see it more like how to keep a child/or pet safe whilst trying to keep the house clean: less stuff, fewer messes, easier to spot what's off.</p>
    <p>Let's take the EC2 service, for example. This would translate into a few very practical moves:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No long-term access keys on the box. IAM Roles only. If a key lives on disk, sooner or later it'll end up in a log, a screenshot, or a repo for all the world to see. Can't be too careful with these kinds of things!</li>
      <li>IMDSv2 or bust. It's the seatbelt for Instance credentials. It's cheap, invisible, and the one time you need it, you'll be glad it's on.</li>
      <li>Patch without babysitting. Systems Manager (SSM) Patch Manager on a schedule. If I have to "remember" to patch, I won't.</li>
      <li>Prefer Session Manager to SSH. Fewer open ports, proper audit trail, no juggling key files. It just removes so many sharp edges. If you've got to have it, though, make sure to lock it up tightly with the right rules.</li>
      <li>Encrypt by default. Turn EBS default encryption ON at the beginning of creating a new EC2 instance and at the account level.</li>
      <li>Least privilege everywhere: tiny IAM policies, minimal packages, minimal open ports. Teeny tiny chance of terrible things happening to the EC2 instance.</li>
      <li>Central logs: send OS logs somewhere I'll actually read them (CloudWatch Logs or a SIEM). Like a post-it on the fridge reminding me to get milk and read my logs.</li>
      <li>Known-good baselines: use Systems Manager State Manager or an AMI hardening pipeline so new instances can start securely. Give the instance its best start by giving it values and configurations it can use.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>Rubber Ducky says: "Give the machine just enough to do its job (IAM Roles), keep it tidy, and don't leave spare keys under the mat."</blockquote>
    <h3>Some services to help keep your Host secure</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Amazon Inspector</strong> is the service that scans your instance for any software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure. Have you left the metaphorical door unlocked, or are you using a rope to secure your side gate? It'll create a detailed report about the status and issues with the instance or other resources you have within AWS, such as EC2, ECR and Lambda Functions.</li>
      <li><strong>GuardDuty</strong> does what you'd think it would from its name. Think of it like a neighbourhood watch for your resource logs and data sources. It doesn't scream unless it sees something actually suspicious. Its main job is to continuously analyse, monitor and process your data and logs by using threat intelligence feeds to protect and prevent potential threats from affecting your resources within your AWS environment.</li>
      <li><strong>CloudWatch Logs</strong> is like the messy drawer where I toss all the logs from EC2, CloudTrail, Route 53, etc… but now it's a messy drawer I can search and actually find things! You can view, search for any particular error codes or patterns, filter the logs using specific fields or archive for later. Helps to have everything in one place, doesn't it?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Network Security</h2>
    <p>Network security was always an enigma to me. No idea what it was but knew that it's important and people who understand it are wizards. Now I understand that if I think about it like making sure that the streets in my neighbourhood are secured and safe, that my home is more likely to stay safer too.</p>
    <p>Safety and security aren't flashy and they aren't supposed to be. The design I like is boring (in a good way): Only the load balancer is public. App and data tiers sit in private subnets. The ALB talks in; nothing else faces the internet.</p>
