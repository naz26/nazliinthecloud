I fell into hospitality, stayed too long, and hit a wall. So I did the unthinkable: resigned, reset, and chased a tech career. This blog traces that pivot, through scattered courses, into AWS re/Start, past a streak of ‚Äúno‚Äôs,‚Äù and finally into Version 1. This is my honest account of the journey through the stress and self-doubt. I cover what actually helped (walks, reading, music/art, journaling, doing scary things, asking for support), the surprising ways hospitality skills carried over, and how the *Ikigai* framework that clarified my direction. I close with practical advice (research, roadmap, future-proof with AI, lean on your network) and where I‚Äôm headed next: CloudSecOps/AISecOps. Do you need proof that starting again is allowed, and worth it? This is it.

### What to expect:
- The leap: resigning first, learning fast, and creating urgency that forced progress.  
- The toolkit: stress/doubt management that‚Äôs practical and repeatable.  
- The transfer: hospitality skills that carried over (time management, docs, learning on the fly).  
- The inflection point: AWS re/Start ‚Üí Cloud Practitioner ‚Üí interviews ‚Üí landing at Version 1.  
- The framework: using **Ikigai** to get direction and momentum.  
- The roadmap: research, skills map, future-proof with AI, use your network.  
- The horizon: specialising toward **CloudSecOps/AISecOps**.
