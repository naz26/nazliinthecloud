From 6:30 a.m. hotel lobbies to CI/CD pipelines, this is my honest account of burning out in hospitality, quitting without a safety net, and rebuilding in tech. I share the messy middleâ€”bootcamps, AWS re/Start, rejectionsâ€”plus the coping habits that actually helped: exercise, journaling, creativity, doing scary things, and leaning on community. Itâ€™s about transferable skills, finding your **Ikigai**, and betting on yourselfâ€”with an eye on Cloud/AISecOps and the future of work.

### What youâ€™ll get in 12 minutes
- The leap: resigning first, learning fast, and creating urgency that forced progress.  
- The toolkit: stress/doubt management thatâ€™s practical and repeatable.  
- The transfer: hospitality skills that carried over (time management, docs, learning on the fly).  
- The inflection point: AWS re/Start â†’ Cloud Practitioner â†’ interviews â†’ landing at Version 1.  
- The framework: using **Ikigai** to get direction and momentum.  
- The roadmap: research, skills map, future-proof with AI, use your network.  
- The horizon: specialising toward **CloudSecOps/AISecOps**.
