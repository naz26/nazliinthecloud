I’m starting a series to document my AWS certification journey. In this post I outline my **study blueprint**, resources I’ll use, and how I’ll evaluate progress.

- Target: *AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate*
- Resources: official exam guide, whitepapers, re:Invent sessions
- Practice: hands-on labs + notes

> Expect weekly updates in this series.
